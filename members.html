            <p>Wording from NWSSPC: "VERY STRONG LOW LEVEL WINDS ARE FORECAST TO DEVELOP OVER
                EASTERN AR/NORTHWEST MS/WEST TN NORTHWARD INTO IL/IND.  THERE IS
                CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE EVOLUTION OF STORMS AS THEY
                PROGRESS INTO THIS ENVIRONMENT.  THE STORMS MAY REMAIN DISCRETE
                ACROSS AR WITH A RISK OF STRONG/VIOLENT TORNADOES...OR THEY MAY GROW
                UPSCALE INTO A FAST-MOVING BOW ECHO WITH THE RISK OF WIDESPREAD
                SIGNIFICANT WIND DAMAGE AND ISOLATED TORNADOES. IN EITHER
                CASE...CONDITIONS ARE CLEARLY FAVORABLE A HIGH-END SEVERE WEATHER
                EVENT WELL INTO THE NIGHT.  FOR THESE REASONS...HAVE EXTENDED THE
                HIGH RISK FARTHER EAST."

                <p>"CONCERNING THE CURRENT SETUP...A LARGE MCS IS ONGOING ACROSS THE TN
                    VALLEY. THIS CONVECTIVE SYSTEM IS TIMED TO MOVE INTO ERN TN AND NW
                    GA BY 21Z. MESOANALYSIS SHOWS A RESERVOIR OF MODERATE INSTABILITY
                    FROM LA EXTENDING EWD ACROSS SCNTRL MS WHERE MLCAPE VALUES ARE
                    ESTIMATED IN THE 2000 TO 3000 J/KG RANGE. THIS MODERATE INSTABILITY
                    SHOULD BE TRANSPORTED NEWD INTO THE HIGH RISK AREA THIS AFTERNOON AS
                    THE MCS EXITS THE REGION TO THE EAST. AS THE THERMODYNAMIC SETUP
                    IMPROVES...THE WIND SHEAR ENVIRONMENT WILL ALSO RAPIDLY BECOME MORE
                    FAVORABLE AS THE NOSE OF A 80 TO 100 KT MID-LEVEL JET EJECTS EWD
                    ACROSS THE REGION AND INTERACTS WITH A WELL-DEVELOPED LOW-LEVEL JET.
                    THIS WILL CREATE LARGE LOOPING HODOGRAPHS FROM ERN MS AND NCNTRL AL
                    NWD INTO SRN TN. 0-3 KM STORM RELATIVE HELICITIES IN THE 450 TO 600
                    M2/S2 RANGE SHOULD BE VERY FAVORABLE FOR TORNADIC SUPERCELLS. THE
                    CURRENT THINKING IS THAT THE GREATEST TORNADO POTENTIAL WILL EXIST
                    LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY THIS EVENING FROM COLUMBUS MS EWD TO
                    BIRMINGHAM AND HUNTSVILLE AL. THIS AREA IS CURRENTLY SOUTH OF THE
                    ONGOING MCS WHERE DESTABILIZATION SHOULD BE MOST FAVORABLE. AS
                    SUPERCELLS INITIATE IN ERN MS AND TRACK ENEWD ACROSS THE HIGH RISK
                    AREA LATE THIS AFTERNOON...A TORNADO OUTBREAK IS EXPECTED. A FEW
                    LONG-TRACK STRONG TORNADOES AND POSSIBLY A VIOLENT TORNADO OR TWO
                    MAY OCCUR AS THE LOW-LEVEL JET STRENGTHENS EARLY THIS EVENING. HAVE
                    ADDED A 45 PERCENT SIG-TOR AREA WHERE CONFIDENCE IS THE HIGHEST
                    CONCERNING THE POTENTIAL FOR LONG-TRACK TORNADOES.  LARGE HAIL AND
                    WIND DAMAGE WILL ALSO BE LIKELY WITH SUPERCELLS THAT DEVELOP"
